<!-- ## "Longevity versus Production: Analyzing Economic Tradeoffs in Dairy Cow Replacement"
### Job Market Paper
Dairy cow milk production has increased about 3-4% annually largely due to genetic selection on milk production traits by dairy breeders.  The negative consequence of this policy has been shorter and shorter productive life, and currently about 80\% of US dairy cow exit is because of a health problem, infertility, or death.  Breeding goals have largely been oriented towards production characteristics because their economic value is better defined than the costs of cows unexpectedly leaving the herd.  In this preliminary work, I focus on how these sorts of exit on dairy farms factor into the replacement decision and how this effects the profitability of the current breeding goals of US dairy cattle.  I construct a structural model of dairy cow replacement that improves upon the model of Miranda and Schnitkey (1995) by including mortality and disposal costs.  I use this model to demonstrate how high disposal cost decreases the replacement age, especially at low profit margins.  Finally, I present a simulation of the model on pseudo-data to show how this model can explain puzzling results found in Miranda and Schnitkey (1995).  This model can be empirically tractable on DHIA data given recent advancements in dynamic discrete choice estimation, specifically the Conditional Choice Probability (CCP) estimator of Hotz and Miller (1993).  



## "Production Credit Associations and Agricultural Productivity Change in the United States, 1920-1940"
### with Brent Hueth
The U.S. Congress initiated policy in 1916 to create what would eventually become a national Farm Credit System (FCS) that continues in operation to this day. The FCS was the first of several “government sponsored entities” (GSEs), as these institutions would later come to be known, created for the purpose of increasing access to credit in targeted economic sectors. The system has been mostly successful in expanding access to credit for U.S. farmers, and with little financial cost to taxpayers. The specific evidence on whether or how the FCS has done this, however, has largely been anecdotal. If and how the FCS has aided the development of U.S. agriculture is interesting in itself, and of particular interest to understanding how this policy instrument can be applied in other contexts. In this paper, we present empirical evidence of the effect of the FCS on agricultural yields, crop value, and use of inputs. We focus on lending by Production Credit Associations (PCAs) that were created to provide short-term production credit, a type of loan that, at the time, was provided almost exclusively by informal “merchant lenders” that charged high rates of interest. Using distances to PCAs as a proxy for credit access, we use a difference-in-difference approach to examine the effects credit expansion on several county-level outcome measures. We find that areas closer to PCAs were less productive than areas farther away before program implementation, but then become more productive in years after.

## "Supply Response in Dairy Farming: Evidence from Monthly Cow-Level Data"
### with Brent Hueth
Recent volatility in milk prices has prompted conversations about government intervention in milk markets in the form of insurance or price supports. In order to evaluate the effects of such programs, it is important to understand how the milk supply responds to prices in this new economic environment. In previous studies, supply responses to milk price and ration cost are almost always found to be small in the short run. Such studies, however, are usually done at the herd and quarterly level where the mechanisms of supply response cannot be distinguished. In fact, supply response may be lower in aggregated data simply due to the biological process underpinning supply. Using a monthly, animal level data set, we analyze supply response at the animal level which isolates the intensive margin response, that is use of more inputs, subject to the production process. Specifically, we estimate price elasticities for each production stage of the cow’s lifetime with different price lags. We find that price responses do differ over the cow’s lifetime and demonstrate that using aggregated data would bias the responses downward. Further, we find that dairy farmers do not respond to current milk prices but rather past realizations.
