excerpt: '*with Brent Hueth, in Submission* <br/>We estimate short-run, price response in dairy farming using nearly 10 million
monthly animal-level observations across 2,311 Wisconsin farms in the years 2011 to
2014. We control for herd size and account for the age distribution of dairy cattle to
identify changes in variable inputs in response to price movements. We find heterogeneous supply response across the animal life cycle to lagged movements in monthly milk
and beef prices. Specifically, we find the greatest supply response in age cohorts with
relatively high marginal returns from feeding, with supply elasticities as high 0.286 for
milk price and 0.713 for beef price.

*with Brent Hueth, in Submission*

We estimate short-run, price response in dairy farming using nearly 10 million
monthly animal-level observations across 2,311 Wisconsin farms in the years 2011 to 2014. We control for herd size and account for the age distribution of dairy cattle to identify changes in variable inputs in response to price movements. We find heterogeneous supply response across the animal life cycle to lagged movements in monthly milk and beef prices. Specifically, we find the greatest supply response in age cohorts with relatively high marginal returns from feeding, with supply elasticities as high 0.286 for milk price and 0.713 for beef price.
