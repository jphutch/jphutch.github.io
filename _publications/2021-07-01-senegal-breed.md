*with Karen Marshall and Aya Missohou, in Submission*

 We analyze the willingness-to-pay for the breeding technology artificial insemination (AI) among dairy farming households in Senegal. A critical component of increasing livestock productivity in low- and middle-income countries is increasing access to new animal genetic resources, specifically cross-bred animals. Since cross-breeds are only available through AI, it is unknown to what extent introducing a new breeding method to farmers is a barrier to adoption. Using a contingent value experiment, we examine how farm households change their valuations of new breeds of dairy cattle when they are offered the breed through AI instead of through natural mating (NM). Our principal finding is that while valuations do not change on average, households who received AI service through a government campaign valued the breed about 25% less when provided through AI. Senegal is a unique case study where the government demonstrated the use of AI through campaigns where AI was provided free of charge. Since the government campaigns had much lower success rates than private providers, we find evidence that low-quality implementation may have affected the perception of the technology and undermined future adoption.
