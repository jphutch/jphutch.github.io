*with Brent Hueth*

Recent volatility in milk prices has prompted conversations about government intervention in milk markets in the form of insurance or price supports. In order to evaluate the effects of such programs, it is important to understand how the milk supply responds to prices in this new economic environment. In previous studies, supply responses to milk price and ration cost are almost always found to be small in the short run. Such studies, however, are usually done at the herd and quarterly level where the mechanisms of supply response cannot be distinguished. In fact, supply response may be lower in aggregated data simply due to the biological process underpinning supply. Using a monthly, animal level data set, we analyze supply response at the animal level which isolates the intensive margin response, that is use of more inputs, subject to the production process.  In our empirical analysis of over ten million animal records, we reject the null hypothesis of no response, finding that milk price and slaughter price do indeed explain deviations from the Wood lactation curve in a manner consistent with facts we know about the biological process.  Interestingly enough, we find that current month milk price does not explain milk production but the milk price lagged 2 months does.  Further, movements in the slaughter price have a much larger effect on production than milk or ration prices.
