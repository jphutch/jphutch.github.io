*with Karen Marshall and Aya Missohou

Improvements in dairy farm productivity have typically come from improvements in cattle genetics.  Delivery of these "improved" genetics to farmers is the most practical and cost effective using artificial insemination (AI) rather than natural breeding, though adoption of AI by dairy farmers in developing countries can be mixed.  In Senegal, several government campaigns have been undertaken to expand access to AI to increase the productivity of the dairy sector with at times mixed success.  In this survey, dairy farmers in Senegal were asked about the advantages and disadvantages of AI and natural breeding as well as their willingness to pay (WTP) for natural breeding and AI of various exotic cattle using a double-bound contingent valuation experiment.  Farmers surveyed listed the main disadvantage of AI as a low success rate and lack of breed choice and generally did not value AI differently than natural breeding.  While farmer characteristics had relatively no bearing on WTP, previous AI use and using a private provider had a significant effect on WTP; in general, those using a private provider valued the technology more.  Given the low success rates of public campaigns, farmers using the public service may value the technology less because of these experiences.  These estimates suggest that Senegalese dairy farmers value AI high enough to purchase it provided that the success rate is high enough, so quality of service should be a priority for the public sector.
