I use a hedonic model to estimate how US dairy producers valued the value production,
health, and physical traits of over 24,000 dairy bulls sold between 2000 and 2010. 
To guide producers toward more sustainable cattle, both governments and breed
associations suggest incorporating new traits into selection indices. To understand the
influence of selection indices on how producers value traits, I compare the valuations
derived from a hedonic model to the valuations assumed in the dairy bull selection
index Net Merit. In a selection index constructed from the hedonic analysis, I find
that physical traits independent of production and health are nearly 50% of the index.
In the USDAâ€™s selection index, these physical traits make up less than 20%. While the
size of the cow factors negatively into the USDA index, body size factors positively
into the hedonic index. Since body size is strongly correlated to methane emissions,
these findings have significant implications for how breeding decisions may contribute
to climate change and whether changing selection indices will meaningfully impact
breeding decisions.
