Milk yields in U.S. dairy operations have increased by over 35 percent during the past two decades, and by an astonishing 155 percent during the past fifty years (Fereira n.d.).  These productivity gains, which are the consequence of systematic selection on genetic traits for milk production, have occurred in combination with significant declines in cow fertility and health (Pinedo, De Vries, and Webb 2010). Some authors argue that existing estimates of productivity gains from increased milk output overstate actual gains because of parallel growth in adverse health and fertility outcomes for dairy cattle (Hansen 2000; Lucy 2001; VandeHaar et al. 2016). A full accounting of productivity change must account for these costs, but existing DHI data collection protocols do not permit their direct measurement. My research seeks to estimate the costs of increased health and mortality risk using DHI data, together with a dynamic structural model of cow culling and replacement behavior. Exogenous variation in the relative cost and return of dairy output, of the price for replacement animals, and of the salvage value for culled cows, together with my model of replacement behavior, permit identification of implicit health management costs. My model builds on prior work Miranda and Schnitkey (1995) by explicitly introducing “involuntary culling,” that is a forced replacement due to a health problem, into the dynamic model as an asset “failure” event along with an additional cost associated with the failure.
