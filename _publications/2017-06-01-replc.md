Dairy farmers in the United States routinely replace their dairy cattle before they reach their maximum, productive potential.
According to the dairy science literature, dairy cows reach maximum output at five years in the herd, yet they are typically removed at around three years.
This paper examines animal replacement behavior for over one-thousand Wisconsin dairy farms during the period 2011-2014 and analyzes the rationale for high replacement rates.
Specifically, I analyze whether the costs of ``unplanned mortality'' cause dairy farms to replace at younger ages.
I model the replacement decision using a dynamic discrete choice model and incorporate unplanned mortality as a source of uncertainty that drives farmers to replace dairy cows earlier than suggested by most dynamic simulations. 
Using the conditional choice probability method, the model results show that perceived mortality cost affects the replacement decisions of small dairies but not of large dairies.
Instead, large dairies replace early because of differences in their production technology relative to small dairies.
