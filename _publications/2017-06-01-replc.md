*Job Market Paper*
Dairy farmers in the United States routinely replace their dairy cattle before animals reach their maximum, productive potential.
On its face, it appears that US dairy farmers are leaving money on the table when they could be keeping animals longer and realizing higher production.
No current economic model has been able to rationalize this behavior.
However, dairy cows have also decreased in lifespan, becoming more and more susceptible to disease and infertility.
In 2006, around 80% of US dairy cow exit was due to a health problem.
I theorize that dairy farmers experience high costs if animals die on the farm,
which incentivizes them to replace their cows early to avoid these costs.
I develop a structural, dynamic discrete choice model to test whether these mortality costs
make dairy farms replace animals sooner; the model estimates the perceived cost of mortality as
well as the perceived age at which milk production is maximized.
I estimate the model using data on dairy cow replacement with the CCP method Hotz and Miller (1993)
bolstered with machine learning prediction methods to improve model performance. 
In a sample of Wisconsin dairy farms, I compute the cost of mortality at around 400 USD, which is about 25% of the average annual revenue of a dairy cow.
Since the cost is independent of the milk price, a cost of 400 USD would be detrimental to the survival of dairy farms in times of low milk prices as in recent years.
