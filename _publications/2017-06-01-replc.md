excerpt: '*Job Market Paper* <br/> This paper examines animal replacement behavior for over 1,000 Wisconsin dairy farms during the period 2011-2014 and analyzes the rationale for high replacement rates. Dairy farmers in the United States replace their cattle at around three years in the herd, well before what the dairy science literature estimates is their maximum productive potential, namely, five years in the herd. I model the replacement decision using a dynamic discrete choice model and incorporate unplanned mortality as a source of uncertainty that drives farmers to replace dairy cows before they maximize production. The empirical model incorporates cow and herd heterogeneity in mortality rates to back out the implied cost of cow mortality and the parameters of the cow's production function. Using the conditional choice probability method, I estimate the cost of mortality at 1,800 USD per death, 800 dollars more than estimates based on simulation studies. Utilizing farm size heterogeneity, I also find that mortality costs are three times higher on small dairies than on larger ones. In a counteractual estimation, dairy farmers were willing to pay 1,300 USD to eliminate mortality risk completely for first year dairy cows. These results suggest that genetic selection in U.S. dairy favors relatively large farms given that declining health disproportionately affects small dairies.'

This paper examines animal replacement behavior for over 1,000 Wisconsin dairy farms during the period 2011-2014 and analyzes the rationale for high replacement rates. Dairy farmers in the United States replace their cattle at around three years in the herd, well before what the dairy science literature estimates is their maximum productive potential, namely, five years in the herd. I model the replacement decision using a dynamic discrete choice model and incorporate unplanned mortality as a source of uncertainty that drives farmers to replace dairy cows before they maximize production. The empirical model incorporates cow and herd heterogeneity in mortality rates to back out the implied cost of cow mortality and the parameters of the cow's production function. Using the conditional choice probability method, I estimate the cost of mortality at 1,800 USD per death, 800 dollars more than estimates based on simulation studies. Utilizing farm size heterogeneity, I also find that mortality costs are three times higher on small dairies than on larger ones. In a counteractual estimation, dairy farmers were willing to pay 1,300 USD to eliminate mortality risk completely for first year dairy cows. These results suggest that genetic selection in U.S. dairy favors relatively large farms given that declining health disproportionately affects small dairies.
