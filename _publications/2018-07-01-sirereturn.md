The productivity of the agriculture sector has been growing for most of the 20th century, and the dairy industry is no exception; specifically, per cow milk yield has been growing nearly 3-4% per year and 50% of this growth is attributed to genetic selection.  Selective breeding of dairy cattle as a vector of productivity growth has been facilitated by both AI and herd testing records. The statistical methods used to evaluate sire genetics in the industry, however, have tended to ignore the role of management in the productivity of genetics. We investigate heterogeneous returns to genetics in the dairy industry using herd testing data and explore the extent to which management practices can hinder or enhance the productivity of certain sires.  We define the cow level production function as a Correlated Random Coefficients (CRC) model of Mundlak (1978) and Heckman and Vytlacil (1998) where there is an average return but also a farm level return that is random.
